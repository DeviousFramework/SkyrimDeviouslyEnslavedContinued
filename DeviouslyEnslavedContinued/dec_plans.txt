; verstort 12/2016
; this is more notes at this point than just plans
; the top is really old, from early 2015, the bottom is the most up-to-date
; search for "todo", above it is the newest todo list, below are some notes on follower dialogue and other stuff

known bugs:
  bug where the player's inventory is not checked at the start of a fresh load
  approach isn't reset after an approach is finished
    doesn't really matter, since it's on a timer anyway
  partial chastity is always on because you set chastity bra to always true if the toggle is off
    I think we fixed this?
  ;fix bug where the mod doesn't recheck vulnerability without gear change, which means quests aren't checked without a gear change
    ; for now: will check every time if the player is not busy
  10.0: guard dialogue overrides arrest dialogue, stuck in loop
    Pretty sure this was fixed with a lower priority
  bug: naked with items doesn't go away when you turn naked off, (nvm, clears once you reset your vulnerability)
    need to rebuild loop to look for MCM changes, bleh, not worth it to detect that kind of stuff
    I mean you can get away with setting a "changes made" bool with those items I guess, just a very minor problem
  NPC walks away after enslavement, should stand still, possibly animate
  slaverun local doesn't work with slaverun reloaded
    issue: not sure if I can just set the quest stage to start it, previously assumed player was being attacked by certain enemies right?

  
general: (old)
add gagged attack? (gagged slaves can still aproach you, new dialogue)
add gag attack? (npc can gag player, context?)
add furniture attack? (out of my league, maybe)?
add spanking attack? (really, this should be implemented from the slave mods)


  get array of random npcs, that don't overlap? (all at once instead, one one function call?)
    never found, switched to alias loading anyway

  add quest cancellation for damsel in distress in cursed loot if playe gets enslaved, or cancel enslave option
    maybe just add a block to prevent added items; currently, protected with general zazBlocking check
  add extra second (minute) delay if the player is detected as busy in certain situations (to help stop gap attacks)
  partial chastity enslave event (vulnerable for wearing certain chastity items)
  finish implementing the timeout
  pet collar application and separate dialogue?
    wish there was a mod that used pet collar as a slavery mechanic
    there doesn't seem to be an easy way to start Maria's Eden or SD+ with pet collar, put this on backburner
  add mcm menu for aggressive animations
  add mcm menu for zaz restraints
  add intimidation/persuasion/illusion dialogue options for the general dialogue (really low priority)
  add furniture attack? (out of my league) (maybe)
; also zaz and xaz is back and working on stuff, might want to wait and see what the can cook up
	if nearbyFurniture != None && vulnerability > 1 (maybe 2)
	; maybe add a way to spawn furniture if the player gives a really bad response, or random but small?
	; could also make it random chance with gag?
		< wait for bad response from player to enslaver>
		Either event first or text, 
		teleporation to Zaz furniture
			replace with walking animation? Can we add bondage first (out of thin air?)
		disable player control in bondage # need debug disable in mcm, won't we, for if stuck
		wait for another member of society to pass by and want you
	@can't refuse, gag?
		sex rape brings you out of furniture, 
		re-enable player controls: natural exit, back to where you were
  add maria sex restriction
  add whore restriction? not sure if this would break some stuff 
  group fragments together into one script ; at LEAST 2 hours of very monotonous work, guarentees 100% save clean will be necessary
  higher than normal chance if thalmor?
  check if the gear has certain tags before setting gearchanged to true
    zbfworn, zadsomething, cursedloot? cd?
    the chest area for nudity
      bad idea, could crash the system if too many items are equipped/unequipped instantly
  figure out how to use a library of code, since I now have three debug functions spread out when I only need one
  mods detection only happens on first load right?
      
new mod idea: add the option for other slaves to walk up to you and ask for freedom if you have a slave and keys
      this fits more with paradise halls than other slave mods

Unanswered Modding questions:
  Is there an easier way to batch compile scripts? dos sucks, I want my bash back
  is there a way to turn on/off all lighting effects (reset)
  Is there a way to quiet papyrus errors or warnings that are of no consequence?
  Is there a way to detect if quest states have advanced?
    would mean we don't need to check if enslaved as often
  Is there a way to view the current factions an actor has in-game?
    for debugging
  Is there an event for entering a scene?
    no, but you can test if in scene, works for now
  At what moment does a pre-script for dialogue actually run?s
	how to build a quest, dialogue from scratch, ect
  can we use vm variables in dialogue faction condition
  can we offload "is player busy" into conditional engine?
    or any other part of the heavy papyrus
  how do we get NPCs to cast spells during dialogue
  how do we detect wizard robes?
  how do we detect if the player commits a crime (must be fast, instant is idea, req < 2 seconds)

Debug report form:
  DE Mod version being tested
  Does the problem persist up to two versions back?
  previous DE version before problem started
  New game, clean save, old save (previous DE version installed)
  Versions of the following: SKSE, Maria's Eden, 
  Memory patch?
  
plans:
  new dialogue:
    Intimidation and persuasion options 
      Intimidate: if the player has a weapon and a speech skill above 40 req
                  if the player has clothes and a skill above 60 req
                  otherwise naked = 80 req
                  what about weapon skills or strength?
                    nvm this got really complicated, users actually have opinions about this one :/
      persuasion: similar to above, but the low levels still require something (mostly enslavement protection?)
                        
    Being arrested by guards because you're tied up already
      obscenity in high moral cities, solitude, windhelm
      weakness in corrupt cities, markarth and riften
      slaverun specific encounter
      nudity + piercings + stain + collar without a master + 
    different behavior for wearing a plugged chastity belt, or wearing CD piercings (naked requirement)
    Attackers for sex remarking on having a key to get you out of chastity or other items, 
      friendly: will offer aid for sex, not always honest
      what happens if the approacher has a key? do we have to unlock the items in code first?
    Approachers walking up and talking to your master if you're maria's eden slave, instead of talking to you
      similarly, can we make the player walk up to the master in SD and pay them for your use?
    Dialogue for Animals taking advantage of player while player is gagged, nude, with no belt
      dog, horse, what other animals are normally non-aggressive? wolves/trolls are almost always agressive
      bestiality is touchy with some folk, needs to be handled carefully.
    being enslaved by high disposition friends/allies, deserves different dialogue
      half the chance of being approached by thugs?
      sex is not limited to aggressive?
      less likely to be sold, more likely to be given/taken directly
      good use of petcollar compared to the other slavey types, needs full implementation though
      will need two lists of NPCs to send in the world, one aggressive, one softer
        too bad we don't have a way to make Maria's eden enslavement more aggressive/relaxed, same for SD+
      if the NPC thinks you have bahavior issues or need training, more likely to send you to "training" mods
        introduced to new dom? There aren't enough of these mods currently.
        aggressive: sent to slaverun, slaves of tamriel, CD as working slave
        softer training: sent to CD through other means, maria's eden to some Dom in the city, mistaken idenity
      
  Finish chasity key detection (new dialog too?)
    need to make sure player is just wearing normally removable DD items, not quest items
    increase chances of enslave/sex if NPC has key
    increases chances if player is plugged
    if user has key, and player is gagged, user references how he has a key
    
			
  integrate maria's eden pimp start? ; need more information
    Need to figure out when the best time to use this is
    bad end to getting asked for sex? how does post-sex even get triggered by DE?


  can we detect if the NPC was recently a user? if so we can eliminate them from the roll
    could probably just use a storageutil variable, key is the same but there's a gametime for start or exit
  
  cunundrum: want to use new dasha items, but don't have a valid place to use them
    can't use on intro to maria eden, new owner might be rich but maria eden doesn't work well with devious devices
    can't use with CD, they use their own custom items

  scene (sold to maria eden): ; mothballed, maria eden is changing too much to know what will be available in the future
    Add items, fade to black
    fade from black ...
    
    NPC followed you, forcegreet, starts talking to you
      condition: standing in one place, tied to zaz furniture, animating
      ...
      remove items, ... (maybe), start()
    


  add arousal for player as vulnerability, and naked requirement
  add code to remove followers from player when enslaved (low priority, because the followers aren't local right?)
  if player has a follower, and sex attack fails +> add device, and pet collar installed, pet collar should have a higher than regular chance
    maybe only if the follower is not nude, and has no slave devices
  if high arousal with follower, and wearing SOMETHING, will get approached by follower for relief
  arousal modifier here to speed it up?
  check gender here too
    if follower convinces player 1-4 times, can lead to pet collar or maria eden

  add enslavement mod variable for static masters
    master's who are static, in the distance, never present to protect their slave in the world
    angrim, CD, Mia's lair, cidhna, ect
  double check DD slave detection settings, make MCM options?
  double check on the devious cidhna quests stages, still haven't played through thei lesser quests
  
  what if user is locked, can ask user with key for release at some cost, like being lola slave for awhile
  
  make sure that the player is vulnerable 2 or higher, and not enslaved, before sexhook
  
  add spells and spell option in MCM menu
  add andrew to detection during mia?
  
  enslave after sex lacks dialogue, just one tiny little notifications, bleh
  look up mcm variable condition use in cursed loot?
    if global, that would be easy

  add more mcm variety for debug (so not all debug is triggered all the time
  attempt to move NPC detection to quests  
    how many of the conditions cannot be moved? factions cannot be used unless hard dependency, otherwise done
    can we even catch MCM options as condition? use globals
    can we even get faction property as condition? so far, haven't found solution
    
  add MCM menu pop up for debug 
    and for intimidation if it doesn't work
    turning on mods that aren't installed?
  look into isle of mara, male on male mod for enslavement and when to not interfere
    no immediately obvious slave status to look for, stuck, postponed
  
  remove cursedloot item detection, replace with keywords?
    leave for now, can't confirm armor detection is any faster/slower than keyword detection, and kimy han't put in more than one in most cases
      rubber exception
   
  add -1 to weapon max, and check if there are any other min/maxes I forgot to include
  Add enslave only option to menu so users can use Dcur sex attacks instead
  re-evaluate mcm init
  deprecate mcm "default value" in mcm, doesn't work anyway just wasting 20-50 lines of code
  
  
  
  stack trace to find the part that calls maintaince more than once
  
  add more SD masters distance
  add gender check for ranged masters (oops)
    
  player more likely to get raped while alone with deviant
    hard to detect number of nearby NPC
    
  rewrite canRun to be less useless, more compartimentalized
    wish I could know if papyrus inlined properly, so I can use more functional programming
    not as important on the code that runs so late in the check
    
  extra items that can be equipped:
    dasha's items
      cursed loot rubber stuff
    angeli's stuff
    aradia might come back?? who knows
    vel's DD infused zaz items, locking, interesting no?
    CD colored items
    Regular colored DD gear (currently only black ebonite right?)
    
  add Maria eden version detection  
  send slave to SD cage instead of just to master
  maria eden, whoring, while dancing, doesn't count as whore (because not wearing whore stuff)
    add exception to being owned (quest)
    or location? nobody would try to steal a whore/slave from a house, the bouncer would kick his ass
  
  make outfits for application instead of lists of items
  rename masterRef to something that makes more sense, since its actually attacker
  
  QAYL quest two stop mod > play through it first
  add enslave outcomes to sex:no if enslave chance > 0

  Stuff that should wait until 11.0
    add zaz furniture check to ref conditions
    
  Extra enslavement ideas (and event ideas)
    put player in zaz furniture/tie up (old idea)
      use spell to teleport player, more in line with lore
        user needs to be mage I think
        or we need a way to walk the player to the device
      cages work too, in the case of something like SD cages?
        force greet often unlocks locked doors
        safety, summon some demon to mess with you instead?
        or an NPC (nearby even)
    (pet collar)
    scene with maria, PO bounty hunter, 
      maria eden is deprecated
    entrance with Slaves of Tamriel?
    custom scenes with certain items, like toys

  added risk: 
    if owner, higher chance
    if trader, can see through clothing
    if alone (might not be easy to find)
    if player orgasmed during sex

  Separate dialogue for carriages:
    if SLUTS is installed, ignore?

  force stripping
    whiterun: if slaverun
      slaves must be naked
      naked or arrested
    immoral cities: if slave
    old people specific?
  for stealing/pickpocketing
    need a way to detect if caught, currently not seeing a condition function
      ; haven't found one yet, oh well
    cursed loot invisible suit counts as nude (maybe already happens? on it's own?)
    new SD version needs testing
      has pickpocket detection? hmm...

  consider tying up the player before sex if walk away
    if we could magic force player into rope, followed by wiggle into armbinder, that might be cool
        needs testing
  add animations to vulnerability, kneeling, arms bound, ect  
    done, untested
  add vel's DD enabled zaz items  
    soft dependancy slow form list load, bleh
    maybe we can import the formlists or the outfits instead?
  break items added to player into "you're a bitch and you need slave items" 
    and "You should lighten up, this collar would look good on you and tell others about your tendencies"

  if actor is maria, higher chance to be enslaved by her specifically
  sexlab solutions check for busy
  wizards/warlocks can send you to meet with sanguine (SD)
    quest doesn't work, giving up for now
  make it so that slavers can enter dialogue if not being approached and not enslaved, and high enough level vulnerable
    meaning, always dialogue
  slavers never enslave locally? heavy sold/given?
    MCM trigger for this maybe... who knows, maybe users don't think this is good enough, SD can work with slavers who move from place to places

  remove DDi textures, trainingplug? shiney thing?
  add wardrobe detection for weapon protection purposes.
    done, MCM option to set vulnerability level and add the other robes too
  
  add for testing:
    slaverun quest forcing, to change the city
    test slavetats some more too
      testbutton3 might give me a better hint
    look at devious surrender again for detection, he's working on it again
         
  add different player response dialogue if the player is super aroused or approached while masturbating
  
  plans to optimise isPlayerEnslaved()
    split into two sections, one that uses item detection, one that doesn't
    move faction checks lower than quest stage checks
    mods that use faction detection, that might have a better option:
      FTD
      Darkwind (dead mod)
      TIR
      ForswornStory
      you know... none of these are commonly used by the average user, so they won't see see a performance hit..
  
  change mod enabled to be a global toggle
    that way, users can still turn it off even if the MCM isn't showing up
    mods can shut it off too

  force stripping
  whiterun: if slaverun
    slaves must be naked
    naked or arrested
      if uncomplient, and wearing softclothing, can strip instead of arrest   
        low armor amount?
  immoral cities: if slave
  old people specific?
    
  add master is not within range protection system
    sex only, unless I have a way to stop those quests
  can we display the source of DHLP?
  
  Return to check out Devious Fame when 1.0 comes out, use fame to lower confidence requirement, and other things
  
  ;Check SD for pickpocket code
  Master wizards can still approach player?
   add BDoD circlet detection
    currently: forhead is always ignored, clearly expression issue
  
  change NPC checking to array instead of single, sorted NPC array with confidence sorting is probably best given conf is last checked
  ; change the NPC count to greyed out, and default 7
  itemtheme watcher/checker needs to be made
  Fight dialogue
    "I'd rather die than be your slave!" <- can we exit out into combat? Might be interesting
    # needs knowledge on how to make the attack you
      console in game, can use "setaggressiveness and setrelationship"
  
  Add debug output for when the fragment fires off for the approach start
  Reduce time in the loop
  Remove random stormcloak guy from the SD thing
  
    add random boots, balerina/slave
  Better detection for slave gear, now that kimy has put every NPC in the world in slave gear
   
  Better interaction with adding items?
    Scene for Multiple devices?
    Fix Cursed collar start, too poorly made
    add stripping animation before outfits
      If adding armbinder, struggle animation as it's being added?  
        Actually doable, since the armbinder itself will cancel out the animation when walking, suposidly

  Rich detection:
    add CD items, gold/silver I mean
    cuffs, belt, percings, plugs?
    Captured dreams random NPCs that buy CDx stuff, can I use that somehow?
      Meaning the dynamic quest NPCs, they buy stuff so they should have his stuff
      Is there an easy way to detect if NPC is in CDx's list of buyers? need to search
  
    
  Add arousal animations # delayed, can't do without a lot more effort

  add slaverun reloaded for slaverun normal turn on
    since slaverun local doesn't work anymore   

  #Change some of the NPC search MCM variables to globals so we can use them in NPC conditions
    # not much to change, the range it the #1 reason they don't still count, followed by arousal *which I can't change* and confidence

  Change/add dialogue for slave to slave interaction
  Naked plus harness doesn't count as slave NPC, or it gets canceled some other way (the girl in SSR long house)

  How would stipping work as an animation anyway?
    
  Add persuasion dialogue
  Add fame to lower confidence requirement
    
  test player animation adding
  seriously, slaverun reloaded integration needs work
  if you're standing near other slaves wearing similar stuff?
    not as easy as I wish it was

  attacker useing user keys doesn't exist yet, for chasitity alone there are few enough key/belt compinations to probably get away with custom function
    gags too
  option to use second leon instead
    nah, we can use the original and just fix it for ourselves, change it back
  +kimy keys for items too
  need to store items we remove, then add them again after, or add ANYthing after

  Black out for leon enslave, animation too  
  Add imperial/stormcloak restrictions to belts
    test belts while we're add it
  add dcur keys to list for detection      

  Remove follower protection if they too are bound? (armbinder + gag)
  figure out how to stop the NPC from walking away while they are busy getting ready to sex you
  
  Find a way to print out current dialogue trees for writers
  Could we add Tattoos during multi-blackout? Need to kang kimy's code I think
  Suddenly fade is probably better   
  
  Turn off ME Defeat warning for > 2.0
  finish making the slaverun dialogue enslave
    write dialogue for slaverun specifically?
  Make exception for mindcontrolled NPCS
  cd plugs
  
    Double check this still isn't a thing
  DEC approach while player is busy with sexlab, can we move this to conditions too?

  Add devious attributes support
    A few mod events should do it
  Add random Item support
    without blocking keyword, and other items turned to zero
  Check how long sex function takes to run
  Can we fix SD so we can sleep in their house without issues?
    ; seems like no
  Test CD amulate on protection belt

  ;Better sd master selection (how about we refresh right after we toggle, and it opens a messagebox?)
  
  Combat dialogue
    Toggle on/off for certain situations (armbinder, gag, whatelse)
    Make sure leg shackles are included? What if DDi no it's open source they can fix if they want
    More options (slave training? running away, level detection)
    
  Remove isSlaver from vulnerability, means we can move vulnerability above NPC search <- big, will take time to separate those parts
  check how much of DEC filter can dissapear to help with the speed
  NPC with bed and cage in fort sunguard annor?
  protect against PAH slaves that are bound on the floor?
    They are already bound though...
  
  Follower do this later needs to trigger a cooldown too, at least until I lower the rate
   
    Regular plug works by scripted object that has enchantment which has magic effect which has script
    trying to detect when player attacks master:
      What I can do is put the master in a quest with a onhit clause
        that fires a mod event that the plug can detect
      might want something better suited
  
    - needs a delay option, lets find a bed/thing
    *** Really need a response after bed is setup
      lock player out of more CRDE inputs, reset if something comes up, with cooldown 2 in-game hours?
      choose sex on bed if available
      
      
    could be a great way to sex animation on a throne or something too
    
  Items follower can find and add:
    Rubber suit collection, 
      Follower can put on the rubber collar afterward
    
  Different dialogue for if the player is already wearing stuff like this 
     
  Measure doplayersex, and compare with the rest of the stuff too
  Test if the crime quest is working better now that it has a higher priority
    ; nope
  ;put belt on afterwards
  
  
  NPCs can approach other NPC?
    Can piggyback on what we already have: if NPC is not confident enough to attack player
    can still attack other nearby slaves?
    we can probably create a list of nearby slaves while checking the nearby NPC list, 
    but also one slave slot might work well enough

  Not enough post aggressive add possible reactions
  Option for follower to suggest putting the item on slave/pet/ect
  Items -> leads to sex from NPC side
  Location in dungeon detect? and/or detect if looted something recently
  Add harness text, along with an item function to add harness and stuff, not just belt and stuff
  

  Slave and follower frustration
  We finally have a use for spanking... maybe.
  Also, new animations for zaz bondage stuff? How to use...
  If other wearing certain collars or gag or... faction?
  Player/follower can't say some things if they are trained and/or levels
  Rubber suit wearing, maybe transparent too?
  
  Random starting positions for followers, if BOTH are set to zero and no previous knowledge (all zero) 
  Rebuild code such that it can return items as well as equip them
  ;MCM options for rate of change
  
  NPC asks if player has ever considered slave training?
  Need a way to keep track of items each follower has put on the player
    Maybe a slot based system where each slot
    No, multislot items are bad
    we need a way to look up per-item, not other way around
    If we could do a keyword -> actor data structure that would be cool
  
  Master hit counts for healing too
  
more recent (not mothballed either):
  
  if player orgasms, nearby followers notice?
    If player is enjoying sex while wearing bondage too
      Certain inprovments based on gear, gag/armbinder/belt/collar/blindfold/buttplug?
  if master, and punishing player, might allow sex attacks?
    Maybe advertising of some kind? Gagged with paint or yoke or something?
  Detect other follower types?
  Write a scene for multiple item adding

  
  If gag and belt, we should check for key so we can remove belt and if already wearing plug, replace
  add sex with follower cooldown? maybe not needed at this point
  Dom for sex with slaves without slave gear
  Base value could be a float
  ;Min containers? Can probably just set to negative right?
  Can we detect where a DD item was equipped from? I mean we can if we're the one's putting them on at least.
  
  Instead of just player location, would be better with player bed actually
  Need code that can detect nearby bed, teleport player to it, with animation
  Maybe we can detect exact location, and then re-use that if the player has sex there it must be a decent spot
  Make sure "at least I can hide it under my armor" doesn't count for armbinder or boots, bood, blindfold? gag should already be immune
  Asks for sex quietly if belted, sub, with player dom
  Find out why followers can just fallout of dialogue for unknown reasons
  If follower dom, can use drip spells on you for disobeying?
  
  Need to test giving rather than equipping
  Need to test devious framework
  Need to make sure SD distant is still working after that last clean
  Need to test milkmod animation detecting with sexlab furniture ; milktest might be causing issues
  
  ;If slave is sub or slave, "your SLAVE wants to talk to you" instead
    ; name trumps this 
  If leaving as slave, dismiss all followers to last home? Can we set that?
  extend want to sell -> no way!
  Follower wants to craft something, you are to be tied up
  If slave is open, follower is horny, and has been let use slave before, might use on their own without asking you.
  
  ;Cuffs count as armbinder on force, probably because there is no fallback for unknown types
  ;libs.DeviousCuffs comes back None???? Need more details about this
    hasn't shown up in awhile
  master takes weapons from slave?
    Especially if submissive AND keeps hitting follower with weapon/spell
  Test all available spanking animations
    Specifically, grab them all
  Notice if player is bound and struggling
  Either add a follower cooldown on sex or make female + female orgasm 
  Follower remembers if the items you are wearing were put on by them, if so no birthday dialogue
    complicated...
  Need more non-equip outcomes
  
  CDx items don't work in dialogue
  "We should sell these" give items to player or follower
  Give to player "working" plugs and some stuff only
  "earring" dialogue never shows up because > 20 is never used
  ;CD items need special rolling?
  ;CDx items roll is based if wearing belt
  if we find special items remove previous?
  
  Gagged follower can still beg
  Follower can beg to be put in bondage
  - less than begging too
  
  Fix horse followers?
  
  If Follower(master) puts items on the player, don't remove for sex in the same fasion
  Test master items manually by added and removing manually
  Give items to player -> equipping messages in notifications and stuff
  
  Follower sex attack needs a bdsm angle
    More Follower Dom in general
    Hey haven't seen you in awhile, needs to not happen with active followers
  Need to retest multi-follower is working
  Need to retest SlaveTats working
  PAH following faction for detecting the difference between a slave that is following and a slave tied up on the floor
  ;If Player is already <itemed>, and player cannot wear another, needs special outcomes
    problem: we need to be able to tell he player what the item is and if they want to interact with it or not.
    
  ;fix captured dreams followerisbusy with the global
  ;fix SD+ alicias in the thing
  ;add the guy from the borken oar place
  ; stopped current follower from commenting on player's birthday
  
  ; fix gagged non-follower is anyone?
  check new CDx stuff
  reset mods on main save
    hope that's not a common thing
  is gunzel already in the list?
  *sl stories needs a dhlp lock
  *several gaged dialogues don't exist
    is this dd or zaz
    healing spell on npc, goodbye
    thank you
    what do you want from us
  *cannot train slaves from PAH home sweet home, huh?
  *broken andrew
  
  ;enslave seems to be timing itself out somehow...?
  ;nearby friends, who are not active followers, count as follower for preventing enslavement (leon)
    ; there is a local protection though right?
  test bed using sexlab framework instead of thread model
  ;distnatenslave is missing itemscript (might be old save issue)
  ;add colored items to random CD items
  ;  just tedius is all
  ;Change ss to "SSLV Entry"
  
  ;Only current followers should find stuff in the wild ?? I think I fixed?
  DEC makes a new onupdate apparently if unclean update???
  
  Follower should unlock player if they have a key for new plug
  PAHE if slave is angry, we can ignore respectful
  Follower can find items locked on them...? Maybe kimy wouldn't like this one
  ;Possibility to find pet collar
    Also other items from other mods that are recognizable? Cursed loot colars for instance.
  ;Possibility to find CD items that are colored too
  ;  Also reduce activity while in certain quests
  More options for non-toy, non-slave sex
  ;If no follower,  <- no easy way to know, just because they aren't near doesn't meant the player isn't spelunking
  
  PAH slaves, even if dom, need to have restraint in their tendency to tie up the player
    if player is not tied up, for now?
  slave trainer
    slave faction 05001D91 
    on sale faction 05008F5C

  Fix Dialogue not ending, just add fragment to the start of the tree, there are too many leafs otherwise
  Fix Follower dialogue ignoring if mod is off and if follower toggle is off  

  We need a variable for "previously had experience with follower"
    But that alone is a waste of a slot, what else can we use such a variable for?
  Punish for hitting follower?
  Hey ...
    maybe avoid if player is slave of certain individuals, or certain mods
    like leon/sasha/maria?
  
  If player is attacked, and slave is attacked, maybe other NPC will rape your slave while you're busy?
  We don't NEED to detect sasha as master I don't think, because probably DCUR lvl 2
    ; ensl 2 vln 3
  Can I detect when the player finds a thing in a thing? If I can, the follower can detect that and confront I think.
  
  Make sure playerhome in playermon is active
  ;check if maybe one of teh look at follower dilaogues are broken
  Sex approach needs a cancel and cooldown
  Fuck my slave, one of the things is missing gag requirement
  Detect the robot
  Detect if follower isn't in a position to be dom (temporary)
  What SD+ sitation do we get in the way of?
  ;Try slavetats again
  set max disposition for characters?
  
  Try out sold follower quest thing
    Make sure that there's a failure option too
    Need list of cages/places where follower can be found
  If CD:
    Follower on display
    Can pay to free follower
    Or can leave them alone... ?

  Try out ME again and see if you can fix the auction?
  Make sure the AI packages can detect in combat and stop themselves
  Containers gets reset too often? might have been fixed.
  
  Reattempt hit detection, but what outcomes? Gag/Armbinder/Belt/
    Can we detect shouts used against followers? I think we can -> gag
  Fix ME becoming a whore, early, is not detected  
  ;Fix men with belts can attack player, silly ( was both genders)
  Search through ME code for fix, try to compile said fix

    ;Run check with list comparison between names and actors to see if they are out of order
  ;  check if int returned is wrong too.
  ;change debug message for adding follower to make sure it has name and ID, if it doesn't already
  complete no nearby NPC case
    Specifically, it locks too many cases I think
  Make sure follower isn't set or checked incorrectly after renaming
  ;"Unlock me please, explode" and "note now, whatever your name is" both missing gag requirements
  
  make a function to check for items in followers inventory that might match what you want (keyword)
  try again to find someone somewhere who knows of a way to assign a script to a quest through MO
  make sure follower stops approaching after certain dialogue, not sure which one it was wouldn't stop, maybe belted + begging?
  need more ways for frustration to manifest and dissipate
    * sex
    * adding items to them if sub, to player if dom
    * frustration while belted and ignored
      * but we also need to make some dialogue to go there
      
      
  ;If SD is still acting weird, is there a way to turn off the follower acting that way?
  Detection if the follower has been to CDx or Dollmakers house, where else...
  We can detect if the follower took items off of the player, right?
  
  
; old, needs cleaning ^
    SNAG: Cannot compile quest fragments, because the fragments are not being stored in the overwrite folder...?
  
  Maybe MCM to allow users to add extra SD+ masters..?
  BUG: if you add a follower manually, one that would be detected normally, they will get twice the item count
  
  13:
  "oh did someone put these items on you? maybe you should remove them if you don't want to be used soon"
   ^- this should probably not be said if the player is only considered naked and they have no items
  Maybe use UIextensions to add interface for hand-picking clothes to count as magic/wizards clothes for intimidation
  DCL lucky charm, maybe we can prevent the player from getting new items through dialogue if they are wearing this?
  If player is in brothel, more vulnerable?
    Extra dialogue for in brothel/freeuse zone?
  
  Maybe extra dialogue, or different dialogue, if the same person appraoches you a second time, especially if you said no last time?
  Higher local chance if you are not outside? not sure this is a good idea
    then again local isn't really a good idea
  Extra vulnerable if caught fondling or yearning in the last 15/20 seconds?
  
  Waiting for lsm to get back to my email about skse for theft/pickpocket detection using skse
  
  new followers system needs to be tested

      +###############+
  
  Changes made since 13.6 (* is esp)
    Fix bug where follower wouldn't approach for sex unless NPC was approaching you? Maybe not if > 1
    
  Follower sold:
    Need to know if we need more than one quest per follower
    otherwise, need multiple locations where cages can be found
    select location at random, move follower there, with AI package of "do nothing" and maybe "move to location again"
    cover follower in certain gear?
  
  Follower takes you home for sex:
    Record last player home we had sex in
    bind player, teleport
     > stuff
    ends in sd enslave or just release?
    can we detect if they have a home that counts as a house? if not, last player house? if not, backup location?
  
  Can you unlock my belt already:
  
  ItemAdding needs: CD belt + plug?
    Full CD set?
    Maybe the full set can replace everything else, so keep it open as an option even when currently locked up tight
    Harness
  
    New Dialogue:
   * Gagged -> "I love it when you look at me like that" alternatives
   Yes master, yes fucktoy alternative, neutral
   "Hey lets try some roleplay" -> Items with timer..?
   "did being plugged in public make you hot" -> sex or something else
     Belt option like gag.
    If follower has punished the player before, thinks they aren't DOM and sub between 1 and 5, can we send them to enslavement?
    Ask follower if items can be removed
    Ask if better items can be bought
    Ask for sex because bothered by items

    
  Bugs:
    ;follower player items aren't considered
      Needs more testing
    Containers searched keeps going up regardless of if you have a follower
      Doesn't reset on new followers either
    player is dom not really considered, and not adding correctly
    special followers aren't considered, dom/sub are always zero for starters
    sex + follower leads to silliness
    follower puts their chest back on immediately after putting on an item
      Maybe swap how it happens? Naked after items added?
      Maybe put chest on again after commenting armor can go on top of it
    Milk pump for MME isn't being detected correctly  
    Necromancer led to belt of shame? huh? ; plug dumbass
    ;In Urn is cut short sometimes... huh  
    
    &$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&
    
    Stalker idea:
    if you say no to the same person more than once, 
        they might show up in the night and rape you in your bed, assuming it's yours
        ALT: rape cave/shack in the woods
        ALT: take them back to their home/house, we need to know that they have one though, 
          and that we can bypass tresspassing
      might also take you home with them in chains?
      or tie you up and be the master in your own house instead?
      maybe also special plug and peircings and belt, can't remove?
        they will show up and unlock you if you keep sleeping in owned beds, keeping you happy?
    : wake up fade from black, bound on bed (hope this doesn't break stuff?)
      custom house maybe if I can't get it to work for all beds
      my home is your home?
    
    Follower dialogue bugs:
    Can pop up in the middle of other stuff
      Mia stuff for one
    Need arousal minimum
    Need slave appraoch, where player is slave and we're being used
    Can get items and enslavement from this sex, bad, need safer sex for follower
    Can we detect if an item was added through script or through player's action?
    
    &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
    Write to MCM:
      Chance of getting follower dialogue
      Chance follower is dom/sub
      Toggle follower can sell you up river?
      
    Creation kit access req:

    TesVEdit req:
      Can we change the form ID for the training plug?
    
    &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
    next big release stuff:
      rename fragment XXX to pf_crde_addDDregular01.psc
      abstract attemptapproach so we can use the same logic for crime and follower
        ; crime is dead
      make nearestRefNPC return array instead of single, so we can know if there are more than one
        good NPCs for confidence, other value checks after the first, and finally group scenes    
    

###############################################################################################################
  
Ideas for dialogue:
  
  Follower asks master for better gear at CD, start quest to go get gear?
  Follower tells slave that you're going shopping at one of the two stores
  Follower wants to try dom against your slave (as s+s)
  Follower wants to try sub as D+D
  Follower wants you to wear a special collar he found earlier.
  Follower wants to punish you, wear gag and sit in bondage furniture for awhile
  Follower wants you to fuck the dog, while wearing a pet collar (gag too?)
  Can we bribe Vel into training our followers?
  if frustrated, after sex send player to slave owner for slave training
    Which mods?
  Player is horny and needs to please men (SRR)
  Player is punished by being put in yoke and other stuff, can be approached for sex, paraded or put into furniture
  I bought this at one of the shops while you were gone

  ;mothballed, too many other mods offer this kind of service already
  player is bound, walks up to user with key for help, sometimes raped, sometimes released, sometimes enslaved
    mmmph
      Can I help you?
      Oh did you need something?
      Gagged? Good, don't bother me.
    non-gagged
      first two from above
        Hey do you have a key for this item?
      
    would be a better idea if there were more enslavement ideas, other than just petcollar, lola and maria
        
  player is approached for sex, asks for money because is whore
    would be great if I could link directly into certain dialogue
    Slut, service me.
      How much?
      Sure thing, 50 septims.
      < if arousal is high enough, this is replaced with do it for free>
      That lump in your pants better have some coin.
      
  player is approached for sex, declines, is thrown into nearby zaz furniture    
  
other mod changes/requests (personal notes):
  cursed loot:
    slut/slave collars swapped
      done without needing to talk to kimmy
    player should be tied after waking up to sex attack
    cursed loot attacks don't take other mods into account, like CDx shop
  wolfclub:
    better interface to start enslavement (event, rather than quest start)
    
  slaverun reloaded: the dialogue about slavery in whiterun can come out of the mouth of gagged slaves
    
**************************************************************************************************************************

ASM Discovery:

  DO NOT use "Mods.prop != None && Mods.prop == thing"
    This shitty compiler will get the prop from the class TWICE, probably because it thinks the state can change

    PROPGET [ID[temptressVixenRace], ID[QQZQQ010], ID[::temp35]]
		CAST [ID[::temp41], NONE]
		CMP_EQ [ID[::temp40], ID[::temp35], ID[::temp41]]
		NOT [ID[::temp40], ID[::temp40]]
		CAST [ID[::temp39], ID[::temp40]]
		JMPF [ID[::temp39], 4]
		PROPGET [ID[temptressVixenRace], ID[QQZQQ010], ID[::temp41]]
		CMP_EQ [ID[::temp36], ID[QQZQQ029], ID[::temp41]]
		CAST [ID[::temp39], ID[::temp36]]
		JMPF [ID[::temp39], 3]
		RETURN [false]
		
  You should MANUALLY reuse local variables, otherwise the compiler makes a new one every single time,
    per place in code, new loop? new local for that loop unless you re-specify
		See above where the same race we get is allocated to two different variables
		Different booleans are used too, even if they aren't needed further in the function

  What...
    HOLY FUCKING BALLS the compiler can't rectify a double negative
 		NOT [ID[::temp22], ID[::temp22]] ; fucking pos -> neg toggle
		JMPF [ID[::temp22], 7]           ; jump on neg
    
  This is weird, why the fuck does it need to cast from a string to an int instead of saving it as an int into the comparison?? Almost every modern CPU instruction set lets you add a constant inline within the instruction
		CAST [ID[::temp391], 20]
		CMP_GE [ID[::temp393], ID[QQZQQ083], ID[::temp391]]
		CAST [ID[::temp393], ID[::temp393]]
		JMPT [ID[::temp393], 4]

**************************************************************************************************************************
    
  Training plug idea:
    Detects who master is
      If player attacks, punishes player <- need testing
      Player gets aroused from whiping
      Player orgasms, only when master does too
        Maybe only when going oral on master?
        "You longlingly think of your master " <- or something like that, if they aren't nearby and player is aroused
        "This <sex> just isn't the same as your master" <- sex with someone else, while not nearby to your master
      If player is not near master, and master is horny, can teleport player to them for sex
      distracts player if not in range of master
    If you try to remove it while still enslaved
      replaced with ghost plug
       until you put it back
       more consequences
        Disappears if you go waaaay far away from your master
          or if you put it back
          or switch masters
    Kinda want corisponding training collar
    If player goes through all training, some effects linger?
      if wearing plug, and/or after effects, cannot say no?
    If master puts a belt on you, and no plug, add this? Can we even catch this?
    
  Snags:
  Can't stop orgasm, can't allow orgasm when stopped by SLARUTIL
  Of course the belt stops orgasms so long as they have sl aroused
    but if collar or piercing...
  Could maybe get away with lowering almost all relationship ranks and such at hte start of sex, and them putting them back later...

***

Princess punishment collar:
 collar made by rich merchants and kings to punish daughters, might backfire
  can teleport player to location as temporary slave
  can bind them in shock gear
  can tie them up in painful furniture
  DM's posture pose furniture?
  temporary tattoos
 could be retrofit by the princess in later life for pleasure rather than pain
  can tie them up in

Follower Parts needed:

; oooookay lets dial this back a bit, start slow with the first approach, work your way up if that's working out

: new :
at least 4 numbers:
  willingness to:
    dominate
    submit
    frustration
  and of course the follower needs to remember this, since different followers have different memories

need to remember when 
  player has sex in restraints
  player has sex with non-followers?
  player buys hooker?
  player has sex wearing restraints
  player is raped and doesn't kill him
    or resist
    can we detect consent or submit?

Can we detect which mod started sex?
  we could use some context for sex

Way to detect nearby followers:
  On cell change:
    If entering CD shop, save CDx variables for reference
    If enter brothel (Maria eden, others)
    Can we detect if the player is in the middle of nowhere?
      Can we detect if nearby enemies?  

Follower happiness:
  Follower dislikes being told no sex multiple times in a row if arousal is above X (90 standard?)
  Follower dislikes being hit in combat (not sure if I can detect this)
  Follower dislikes sitting still too long in the cold (not sure if I can detect this)
  Follower dislikes being given short sex
  Follower likes being given long sex
  Follower likes getting oral especially (user set happyiness based on type of sex: oral/anal/vag/boob)
  Follower likes getting to use toys
  Follower dislikes not getting his turn

Follower submission:?
  How could we guess this personality?
  User assigned in the menu maybe?
  characteristics for 
    horny, submissive, aggressive,

Player submission:
  Based on choices
  Willingness to have sex while bound (item selection)
  would be cool if there was a reverse enslave option for having a slave, that wasn't bound, that turned on you by enslaving you instead

MCM options:
  Ceiling for follower happiness
  Floor for follower annoyance

Don't forget to add "Clementine will remember that"

Dialogue: 
Chance based on Follower arousal and player arousal, follower must be X aroused for over X seconds, or reach Y arousal
Follower states he's really bothered.

Extra feature: Follower can show disapointment if the user has short sex -> reactions depending on gender and available bondage gear

# this is old, look at follower dialogue instead
player is approached by friendly NPC, because NPC has noticed player likes it (()
    
    player started:
      Hold my keys? 
      Remove my items?
      Wanna sex?
      Hey check this out! I think it might look good on you!
    
    Hey, I know you like bondage, check this out! ; can we detect dead bodies and/or area with interesting treasure
      <show item they found>
      <talk about sex shop where you can buy stuff (CD,calypses?)>
    Hey, <name> lets have sex <- needs alternative
      passive answers high chance to say no, decreases with every no
      Go fuck yourself
      Or do you need a whore? Lets head to town (passive, can only use 2-3 times in a row before he grows impatient)
        Sometimes agrees, sometimes wants something else
      Yes, but lets move
        Option for public or private, even furniture?      
      No you need to calm down
        Chastity option?
        We're in bad area (excuse)
        Gag them
        Arm tie them
      
    Hey why don't we play a game?/?//
    I've noticed how much you enjoy having sex while tied up, I know this great guy who would like to tie you up.
      submissive option -> become slve
        if there was a sex with this guy, then dialogue, that would be cool but needs more work
      aggressive no if follower is slave (intimidate)
      say no
        double checked
          ...yes: points back to above
          no 
            dropped
            submissive training (needs available mods)
            rape? needs to be rare
            sex?
              ?
              
    Want to join in?
      Added actor to array, extra for sex
  follower remarks about player while player is busy with sex tied up and/or rape orgasm    

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

need to test:
  Slaverun Reworked
  Mia's lair again?
    fix Mia's lair start state problems, the end of the onthetrail quest should also probably be protected, since the player is busy with slaves
      fixed?? needs testing
  Retest the DEC enslavement entrances, checking for which ones are the slowest, longest
  All items seem to work, only one I didn't test properly was rubber doll
  cursed loot invis suit count as nude or do I have to put that in myself?
    Which suit? Rubber byitself doesn't work
  
bleed out events:
IdleForceDefaultState
BleedOutStart <- locks movement

Save cleaning piority:
  Inited variables in ESP

Changes to title:

Things I need to learn:
  how to scene
  slow get up
    how to stagger from laying position
  how to detect if a dungeon is cleared
  
???????????????????????????????????????

The fucking quest fragment dance:
Make quest, make objective, make fragment.
Fragment must exist in skyrim/data
you must use
;BEGIN FRAGMENT Fragment_10
Function Fragment_10()
;BEGIN CODE
; do something in frag 10
;END CODE
EndFunction
;END FRAGMENT
to write a fragment inthe file first after regeneration

THEN IT STILL WONT WORK WHAT YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS LOGIC YOU FUCKING IDIOT

Lola notes:
Sex is unlikely to happen
Too much pissing
Bad spelling
Master STOPS when he's interested
Master WALKS AWAY INTO A BUILDING when he's interested
