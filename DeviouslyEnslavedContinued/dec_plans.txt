; verstort 7/2017
; this is more notes at this point than just plans
; the top is really old, from early 2015, the bottom is the most up-to-date
; search for "more recent", above it is the newest todo list, below are some notes on follower dialogue and other stuff

known bugs:
  player's inventory is not checked at the start of a fresh load
  partial chastity is always on because you set chastity bra to always true if the toggle is off
    I think we fixed this?  
    
  Containers searched keeps going up regardless of if you have a follower
    Doesn't reset on new followers either
  Containers resets if the forcegreet starts, but if it cancels the containers doesn't revert
  player is dom not really considered, and not adding correctly
  special followers aren't considered, dom/sub are always zero for starters
    Minor thing, setting defaults for all followers can get hairy if the users want to set them
  follower puts their chest back on immediately after putting on an item
    Maybe swap how it happens? Naked after items added?
    Maybe put chest on again after commenting armor can go on top of it
  Milk pump for MME isn't being detected correctly  
  NPC is walking away after attack, again, instead of animating... why?

  
Debug report form:
  DE Mod version being tested
  Does the problem persist up to two versions back?
  previous DE version before problem started?
  New game, clean save, old save (previous DE version installed)
  Versions of the following: SKSE, Maria's Eden, 
  Memory patch?  
  Can you hand me the save in addition to the log? save could have interesting information
  
 vvv------vVv------vvv THIS IS OLD, SKIP TO "more recent" vvv------vVv------vvv
 legend (start of the line):
 ; <- fixed, leave for a version before removing
 * <- high priority 
 $ <- relook at later
 
add gagged attack? (gagged slaves can still aproach you, new dialogue)
add gag attack? (npc can gag player, context?)
add furniture attack? (out of my league, maybe)?
add spanking attack? (really, this should be implemented from the slave mods)

  get array of random npcs, that don't overlap? (all at once instead, one one function call?)
    never found, switched to alias loading anyway
  add furniture attack? (out of my league) (maybe)
  higher than normal chance if thalmor?
  
plans:
  new dialogue:

    different behavior for wearing a plugged chastity belt, or wearing CD piercings (naked requirement)
    Approachers walking up and talking to your master if you're maria's eden slave, instead of talking to you
      similarly, can we make the player walk up to the master in SD and pay them for your use?
    being enslaved by high disposition friends/allies, deserves different dialogue
      half the chance of being approached by thugs?
      sex is not limited to aggressive?
      less likely to be sold, more likely to be given/taken directly
      good use of petcollar compared to the other slavey types, needs full implementation though
      will need two lists of NPCs to send in the world, one aggressive, one softer
        too bad we don't have a way to make Maria's eden enslavement more aggressive/relaxed, same for SD+
      if the NPC thinks you have bahavior issues or need training, more likely to send you to "training" mods
        introduced to new dom? There aren't enough of these mods currently.
        aggressive: sent to slaverun, slaves of tamriel, CD as working slave
        softer training: sent to CD through other means, maria's eden to some Dom in the city, mistaken idenity
          
         
  add andrew to detection during mia?
  
  add -1 to weapon max, and check if there are any other min/maxes I forgot to include
  Add enslave only option to menu so users can use Dcur sex attacks instead
  deprecate mcm "default value" in mcm, doesn't work anyway just wasting 20-50 lines of code
   
  player more likely to get raped while alone with deviant
    
  rewrite canRun to be less useless, more compartimentalized
    wish I could know if papyrus inlined properly, so I can use more functional programming
    not as important on the code that runs so late in the check
    
  extra items that can be equipped:
    dasha's items
      cursed loot rubber stuff
    angeli's stuff
    aradia might come back?? who knows
    vel's DD infused zaz items, locking, interesting no?
    CD colored items
    Regular colored DD gear (currently only black ebonite right?)
    
  send slave to SD cage instead of just to master (sd, hard)
  
    
  Extra enslavement ideas (and event ideas)
    put player in zaz furniture/tie up (old idea)
      use spell to teleport player, more in line with lore
        user needs to be mage I think
        or we need a way to walk the player to the device
      cages work too, in the case of something like SD cages?
        force greet often unlocks locked doors
        safety, summon some demon to mess with you instead?
        or an NPC (nearby even)
    (pet collar)
    scene with maria, PO bounty hunter, 
      maria eden is deprecated
    entrance with Slaves of Tamriel?
    custom scenes with certain items, like toys

  added risk: 
    if owner, higher chance
    if trader, can see through clothing
    if alone (might not be easy to find)
    if player orgasmed during sex

  force stripping
    whiterun: if slaverun
      slaves must be naked
      naked or arrested
    immoral cities: if slave
    old people specific?
  for stealing/pickpocketing
    need a way to detect if caught, currently not seeing a condition function
      ; haven't found one yet, oh well
    cursed loot invisible suit counts as nude (maybe already happens? on it's own?)
    new SD version needs testing
      has pickpocket detection? hmm...

  consider tying up the player before sex if walk away
    if we could magic force player into rope, followed by wiggle into armbinder, that might be cool
        needs testing

  if actor is maria, higher chance to be enslaved by her specifically
  sexlab solutions check for busy
  make it so that slavers can enter dialogue if not being approached and not enslaved, and high enough level vulnerable
    meaning, always dialogue
  slavers never enslave locally? heavy sold/given?
    MCM trigger for this maybe... who knows, maybe users don't think this is good enough, SD can work with slavers who move from place to places
  
  add for testing:
    slaverun quest forcing, to change the city
    test slavetats some more too
      testbutton3 might give me a better hint
    look at devious surrender again for detection, he's working on it again
         
  add different player response dialogue if the player is super aroused or approached while masturbating
  
  plans to optimise isPlayerEnslaved()
    split into two sections, one that uses item detection, one that doesn't
    move faction checks lower than quest stage checks
    mods that use faction detection, that might have a better option:
      FTD
      Darkwind (dead mod)
      TIR
      ForswornStory
      you know... none of these are commonly used by the average user, so they won't see see a performance hit..
  
  change mod enabled to be a global toggle
    that way, users can still turn it off even if the MCM isn't showing up
    mods can shut it off too

  force stripping
  whiterun: if slaverun
    slaves must be naked
    naked or arrested
      if uncomplient, and wearing softclothing, can strip instead of arrest   
        low armor amount?
  immoral cities: if slave
  old people specific?
     
  Return to check out Devious Fame when 1.0 comes out, use fame to lower confidence requirement, and other things
  
  ;Check SD for pickpocket code
  Master wizards can still approach player at college?
  
  change NPC checking to array instead of single, sorted NPC array with confidence sorting is probably best given conf is last checked
  ; change the NPC count to greyed out, and default 7
  itemtheme watcher/checker needs to be made
  Fight dialogue
    "I'd rather die than be your slave!" <- can we exit out into combat? Might be interesting
    # needs knowledge on how to make the attack you
      console in game, can use "setaggressiveness and setrelationship"
  
  Add debug output for when the fragment fires off for the approach start
  Reduce time in the loop
  Remove random stormcloak guy from the SD thing
  
    add random boots, balerina/slave
  Better detection for slave gear, now that kimy has put every NPC in the world in slave gear
   
  Better interaction with adding items?
    Scene for Multiple devices?
    Fix Cursed collar start, too poorly made
    add stripping animation before outfits
      If adding armbinder, struggle animation as it's being added?  
        Actually doable, since the armbinder itself will cancel out the animation when walking, suposidly

  Rich detection:
    add CD items, gold/silver I mean
    cuffs, belt, percings, plugs?
    Captured dreams random NPCs that buy CDx stuff, can I use that somehow?
      Meaning the dynamic quest NPCs, they buy stuff so they should have his stuff
      Is there an easy way to detect if NPC is in CDx's list of buyers? need to search
  
    
  Add arousal animations # delayed, can't do without a lot more effort

  add slaverun reloaded for slaverun normal turn on
    since slaverun local doesn't work anymore   

  #Change some of the NPC search MCM variables to globals so we can use them in NPC conditions
    # not much to change, the range it the #1 reason they don't still count, followed by arousal *which I can't change* and confidence

  Change/add dialogue for slave to slave interaction
  Naked plus harness doesn't count as slave NPC, or it gets canceled some other way (the girl in SSR long house)

  How would stipping work as an animation anyway?
      
  test player animation adding
  seriously, slaverun reloaded integration needs work
  if you're standing near other slaves wearing similar stuff?
    not as easy as I wish it was

  attacker useing user keys doesn't exist yet, for chasitity alone there are few enough key/belt compinations to probably get away with custom function
    gags too
  option to use second leon instead
    nah, we can use the original and just fix it for ourselves, change it back
  +kimy keys for items too
  need to store items we remove, then add them again after, or add ANYthing after

  Black out for leon enslave, animation too  
  add dcur keys to list for detection      

  % Remove follower protection if they are also are bound? (armbinder + gag) 
  
  Add devious attributes support
    A few mod events should do it
  
  Combat dialogue
    Toggle on/off for certain situations (armbinder, gag, whatelse)
    Make sure leg shackles are included? What if DDi no it's open source they can fix if they want
    More options (slave training? running away, level detection)
    
  % check how much of DEC pre-sex filter can dissapear to help with the speed
  NPC with bed and cage in fort sunguard annor?
  

  Items follower can find and add:
    Rubber suit collection, 
      Follower can put on the rubber collar afterward
    
  Different dialogue for if the player is already wearing stuff like this 
  
  
  NPCs can approach other NPC?
    Can piggyback on what we already have: if NPC is not confident enough to attack player
    can still attack other nearby slaves?
    we can probably create a list of nearby slaves while checking the nearby NPC list, 
    but also one slave slot might work well enough

  Not enough post aggressive add possible reactions
  Option for follower to suggest putting the item on slave/pet/ect
  Items -> leads to sex from NPC side
  Location in dungeon detect? and/or detect if looted something recently
  Add harness text, along with an item function to add harness and stuff, not just belt and stuff
  
  Slave and follower frustration
    We finally have a use for spanking... maybe.
  Also, new animations for zaz bondage stuff? How to use...
  If other wearing certain collars or gag or... faction?
  Player/follower can't say some things if they are trained and/or levels
  Rubber suit wearing, maybe transparent too?
  
  Random starting positions for followers, if BOTH are set to zero and no previous knowledge (all zero) 
  Rebuild code such that it can return items as well as equip them
  
  NPC asks if player has ever considered slave training?
  Need a way to keep track of items each follower has put on the player
    Maybe a slot based system where each slot
    No, multislot items are bad
    we need a way to look up per-item, not other way around
    If we could do a keyword -> actor data structure that would be cool
  
  Master hit counts for healing too
  
more recent (not mothballed either):
  
  if player orgasms, nearby followers notice?
    If player is enjoying sex while wearing bondage too
      Certain inprovments based on gear, gag/armbinder/belt/collar/blindfold/buttplug?
  if master, and punishing player, might allow sex attacks?
    Maybe advertising of some kind? Gagged with paint or yoke or something?
  Detect other follower types?
  Write a scene for multiple item adding (visbile/animated?)

  Instead of just player location, would be better with player bed actually
  Maybe we can detect exact location, and then re-use that if the player has sex there it must be a decent spot
  If follower dom, can use drip spells on you for disobeying?
    Maybe if we give them the book?
  
  Need to test milkmod animation detecting with sexlab furniture ; milktest might be causing issues
  
  If leaving as slave, dismiss all followers to last player home? Can we set that in code? Should be able too...
  extend want to sell -> "no way!" option
  Follower wants to craft something, you are to be tied up while they work
    If only we could let the player be "used" during that period by other people
  If slave is open, follower is horny, and has been let use slave before, might use on their own without asking you.
  
  Either add a follower cooldown on sex or make female + female orgasm 
  Follower remembers if the items you are wearing were put on by them, if so no birthday dialogue
    complicated...
  Need more non-equip outcomes
  
  Gagged follower can still beg
  Follower can beg to be put in bondage
  - less than begging too
  
  Fix horse followers?
  
  & Test master items memory, manually by added and removing manually
  
  Follower sex attack needs a bdsm angle
    More Follower Dom in general
    Hey haven't seen you in awhile, needs to not happen with active followers
  Need to retest multi-follower is working
  Need to retest SlaveTats working (wasn't there a mod to fix?)
  PAH following faction for detecting the difference between a slave that is following and a slave tied up on the floor
  ;If Player is already <itemed>, and player cannot wear another, needs special outcomes
    problem: we need to be able to tell he player what the item is and if they want to interact with it or not.
           
  % Follower should unlock player if they have a key for new plug
  % PAHE if slave is angry, we can ignore respectful
 
  % If player is attacked, and slave is attacked, maybe other NPC will rape your slave while you're busy?
  % Can I detect when the player finds a thing in a thing? If I can, the follower can detect that and confront I think.
    "Oh cool, a vibrator, I wonder how we could make this interesting... Oh look a harness too"
  
  Detect the robot (SD+)
  set max disposition for characters?
  
  Try out sold follower quest thing
    Make sure that there's a failure option too
    Need list of cages/places where follower can be found
  If CD:
    Follower on display
    Can pay to free follower
    Or can leave them alone... ?
  
  Fix ME becoming a whore, early, is not detected  
  Search through ME code for fix, try to compile said fix
  
  make a function to check for items in followers inventory that might match what you want (keyword)
  try again to find someone somewhere who knows of a way to assign a script to a quest through MO
  make sure follower stops approaching after certain dialogue, not sure which one it was wouldn't stop, maybe belted + begging?
  need more ways for frustration to manifest and dissipate
    * sex
    * adding items to them if sub, to player if dom
    * frustration while belted and ignored
      * but we also need to make some dialogue to go there
      
      
  ;If SD is still acting weird, is there a way to turn off the follower acting that way?
  Detection if the follower has been to CDx or Dollmakers house, where else...
  We can detect if the follower took items off of the player, right?
  
  Can we detect which mod started sex?
    we could use some context for sex
    SNAG: Cannot compile quest fragments, because the fragments are not being stored in the overwrite folder...?
  
  Maybe MCM to allow users to add extra SD+ masters..?
  BUG: if you add a follower manually, one that would be detected normally, they will get twice the item count
  
  % if we find special items remove previous?
  Can we detect where a DD item was equipped from? I mean we can if we're the one's putting them on at least.
  % Notice if player is bound and struggling
  Can we fix SD so we can sleep in their house without issues?
    ; seems like no
  
  13:
  
  Maybe extra dialogue, or different dialogue, if the same person appraoches you a second time, especially if you said no last time?
  Higher local chance if you are not outside? not sure this is a good idea
    then again local isn't really a good idea ...
  Extra vulnerable if caught fondling or yearning in the last 15/20 seconds?
  
  Waiting for lsm to get back to my email about skse for theft/pickpocket detection using skse
  ^- gah, he actually did insert assmebler into the esp, fucking hell I'm not messing with that

  If anal with plug, can they cum with sound effect and notificaiton?
    Maybe vib effect too? Orgasm effect is dangerous because of animation override.
  Does follower hit detection care about shouts yet?
  Slavetats: detect those tattoos that count as weapons

  ;We need to swap zbf keywords for zad keywords, or add them as additional: looks like kimy has finally scrapped ZAZ from cursed loot
  ;Sex through PAHE and PAHHSH counts as sex we should allow enslavment and items for
  Follower with DCUR gag could talk to player, sigh
    god damn it kimy...
    
  14:
  player is stuck performing oral on attacker if belted
    we should check to make sure there are oral animations available to the player?
    if cunnilingus is used, we need to flip the "victim" as the player is the one being sucked off which is backwards
    The whole pre-sex animation filter should be re-written with female vag suppression tag avoidance in mind, it's too hard to follow right now
   
  ;If we turn off the follower ai package after sex, instead of at the start of the dialogue, we can prevent from walking away
  ;  Problem: they will keep talking to you, we almost need a second ai package that just follows you and doesn't talk to you
  ;  time estimate: 2 hours
   
   forwarded:
  Test all available spanking animations
    Specifically, grab them all in testing
  make it so that the follower can replace non-blocking collars, and check for it the present collar is removable through DCUR
    means writing a function or two
  Wait several seconds and disable the struggle animation for enslavement, since it doesn't self cancel
    How does DD handle this? can I just make an event that catches movement once and then forget? would that be safe?
  Maybe use UIextensions to add interface for hand-picking clothes to count as magic/wizards clothes for intimidation
  DCL lucky charm, maybe we can prevent the player from getting new items through dialogue if they are wearing this?
  If player is in brothel, more vulnerable?
    Extra dialogue for in brothel/freeuse zone?

  detect proximity to bed for sex approach percentage (1.5?)

    
  Follower game planning:
    Items: Book with DD stuff, DD vibrating spells, collar, set of items (rubber, leather, heavy collar/gag/blindfold)
      whip, harness? Piercings.
  
  check for SD+ ending slave states to see what we need to set detection for
  check DCL quest end detection again

  sexlab kidnapped and pitfall detection are broken and need to be fixed
  make sure the items found are acceptable to user
    god this one could be annoying, you would have to have a switch case for keywords
  
  check if new DD items can be integrated
  check what we have to do with this new keyword
  add an NPC from morvunskar to SD distant, especially with the cages could be good place, lots of NPC, beds, cages, chairs, enchanting tables, walking distance

  add a dialogue for follower finding lucky charms from DCL if they exist
  add DF API calls instead of doing everything myself...? hope this is actually useful
  
  
  followers that found keys did not actually get keys
  add special finding key stuff, not just pocketing it
    - removing and masterbating
    - removing and running to player for sex
    - bringing key to player for safe keeping
  
  UI busy removed, might be an issue at some points * became issue, would interupt dialogue
  add random chance follower already had key (even if you have to add them yourself)
  add random chance attacker already had a key (even if you have to add them yourself)
  NPC analysis takes too long to work, we need to look deeper
  test maria eden again? 
  
  ;fix typo in follower approach

  ;fix TODO get name
  ;fix TODO do sex?
  ; cleaned up dialogue
  ;add dialogue for second follower sex?
    needs more though
  ;fix the dual MCM slider
  ;set that unfinished guard dialogue to unfinished
  ;fix the negative frustration
  look for permanent follower reset reason
  ;finish the threesome script, and others
  check to make sure the follower replaces items with the right one
  check to make sure cursed loot items cannot be super imposed * not seeing anything here...
  
  ;"now how are we going to have sex" for boots and gloves
  ;Follower gagged, how does it feel, happy response?
  Can we test for PAHE slave being angry?
  - maybe special dialogue though...
  make sure our hasFollowers change didn't break everything, need to test with 2 slave followers
  
  
  ;sex ignores chastity belt blocking vagina on old save <- bad belts, CD
  approaches at lvl 0...? why does wearings boots show lvl 0 but allow appraoches?
  ;bandit, gagged and naked with zbf items wasn't considered slave and attacked me
  ;  zbf items was turned off, but the slave and slaver factions weren't loaded into mods either, hope that fixes it.
  weapon out doesn't help with enslave approach???
  
  
  Lets check the follower to see if they look like an owner/master, and if not can backfire
  ;attacker + follower 3 some if follower is horny?
  lower arousal of attacking NPC if follower scares them off?
  
  Dialogue option to beg for keys back and/or unlocking from previous items
  - needs additional dialogue
  
  always: new followers system needs to be tested more

  Stuff to do when I get access to the esp again:
          
      
  Follower sold/rescue:
    Need to know if we need more than one quest per follower
    otherwise, need multiple locations where cages can be found
    select location at random, move follower there, with AI package of "do nothing" and maybe "move to location again"
    cover follower in certain gear?
  
  Follower takes you home for sex:
    Record last player home we had sex in
    bind player, teleport
     > stuff
    ends in sd enslave or just release?
    can we detect if they have a home that counts as a house? if not, last player house? if not, backup location?
  
  
  ItemAdding needs: CD belt + plug?
    Full CD set?
    Maybe the full set can replace everything else, so keep it open as an option even when currently locked up tight
    Harness
    
    
    &$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&&$&$&
    
    Stalker idea:
    if you say no to the same person more than once, 
        they might show up in the night and rape you in your bed, assuming it's yours
        ALT: rape cave/shack in the woods
        ALT: take them back to their home/house, we need to know that they have one though, 
          and that we can bypass tresspassing
      might also take you home with them in chains?
      or tie you up and be the master in your own house instead?
      maybe also special plug and peircings and belt, can't remove?
        they will show up and unlock you if you keep sleeping in owned beds, keeping you happy?
    : wake up fade from black, bound on bed (hope this doesn't break stuff?)
      custom house maybe if I can't get it to work for all beds
      my home is your home?
    Maybe you wake up in a castle, the guy you said no to was friends of a yarl/guards?
      Could be a decent way to get throne sex animations too
    
    Follower dialogue bugs:
    Can pop up in the middle of other stuff
      Mia stuff for one
    Need arousal minimum
    Need slave appraoch, where player is slave and we're being used
    Can get items and enslavement from this sex, bad, need safer sex for follower
    Can we detect if an item was added through script or through player's action?
    
    &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
    Write to MCM:
      Chance of getting follower dialogue
      Chance follower is dom/sub
      Toggle follower can sell you up river?
      
    Creation kit access req:

    TesVEdit req:
      Can we change the form ID for the training plug?
    
    &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
    next big release stuff:
      rename fragment XXX to pf_crde_addDDregular01.psc
      abstract attemptapproach so we can use the same logic for crime and follower
        ; crime is dead
      make nearestRefNPC return array instead of single, so we can know if there are more than one
        good NPCs for confidence, other value checks after the first, and finally group scenes    
    

###############################################################################################################
  
Ideas for dialogue:
  
  Follower asks master for better gear at CD, start quest to go get gear?
   extended: Follower tells slave that you're going shopping at one of the two stores
  Follower wants to try dom against your slave (as s+s or m+s)
  Follower wants to try sub as d+d
  Follower wants to punish you, wear gag and sit in bondage furniture for awhile, must be in an area where they can wander around? can I force the AI to wander?
  Follower wants you to fuck the dog, while wearing a pet collar (gag too?)
    need to detect if beast stuff available, or maybe just pet collar
  Can we bribe Vel into training our followers?
  if frustrated, after sex send player to slave owner for slave training
    Which mods?
  Player is horny and needs to please men (SRR)
  Player is punished by being put in yoke and other stuff, can be approached for sex, paraded or put into furniture
  I bought this at one of the shops while you were gone
     * Gagged -> "I love it when you look at me like that" alternatives
   "Hey lets try some roleplay" -> Items with timer..?
   "did being plugged in public make you hot" -> sex or something else
     Belt option like gag.
    If follower has punished the player before, thinks they aren't DOM and sub between 1 and 5, can we send them to enslavement?
    Ask follower if items can be removed
    Ask if better items can be bought
    Ask for sex because bothered by items


  ; problem with this one is that you either ignore the other prostitution mods by making your own, or make them hard requirments
  ; ME is only alt, because ME has a separate dialogue, so we can just fall onto it
  ;player is approached for sex, asks for money because is whore
    would be great if I could link directly into certain dialogue
    Slut, service me.
      How much?
      Sure thing, 50 septims.
      < if arousal is high enough, this is replaced with do it for free>
      That lump in your pants better have some coin.
      
  player is approached for sex, declines, is thrown into nearby zaz furniture
    teleport? walking is meh
    this would be a higher priority if I could get code that would allow sex in furniture without furniture replacement

Unanswered Modding questions:
  is there a way to turn on/off all lighting effects (reset)
  Is there a way to quiet papyrus errors or warnings that are of no consequence? no exception/error catching it seems
  Is there a way to detect if quest states have advanced?
    like an event, you can detect if the stage has increased manually with a saved variable, but doesn't buy us much over state
  Is there a way to view the current factions an actor has in-game?
    for debugging
  Is there an event for entering a scene?
    no, but you can test if in scene, works for now
  At what moment does a pre-script for dialogue actually run?s
  can we offload "is player busy" into conditional engine?
    or any other part of the heavy papyrus
  how do we get NPCs to cast spells during dialogue

ASM Discovery:

  DO NOT use "Mods.prop != None && Mods.prop == thing"
    This compiler will get the prop from the class TWICE, probably because it thinks the state can change

    PROPGET [ID[temptressVixenRace], ID[QQZQQ010], ID[::temp35]]
		CAST [ID[::temp41], NONE]
		CMP_EQ [ID[::temp40], ID[::temp35], ID[::temp41]]
		NOT [ID[::temp40], ID[::temp40]]
		CAST [ID[::temp39], ID[::temp40]]
		JMPF [ID[::temp39], 4]
		PROPGET [ID[temptressVixenRace], ID[QQZQQ010], ID[::temp41]]
		CMP_EQ [ID[::temp36], ID[QQZQQ029], ID[::temp41]]
		CAST [ID[::temp39], ID[::temp36]]
		JMPF [ID[::temp39], 3]
		RETURN [false]
		
  ;You should MANUALLY reuse local variables, otherwise the compiler makes a new one every single time,
  ;  per place in code, new loop? new local for that loop unless you re-specify
	;	See above where the same race we get is allocated to two different variables
	;	Different booleans are used too, even if they aren't needed further in the function
  Unlikely, but since this is byte code not machine code, it could optimize it out

  HOLY FUCKING BALLS the compiler can't rectify a double negative
  It just compiles what it sees one for one, regardless of whether it can shorten a cpu cycle off or not
 		NOT [ID[::temp22], ID[::temp22]] ; fucking pos -> neg toggle
		JMPF [ID[::temp22], 7]           ; jump on neg, instead of jump on pos
    
  This is weird, why the fuck does it need to cast from a string to an int instead of saving it as an int into the comparison??
  Almost every modern CPU instruction set lets you add a constant inline within the instruction, is this left over from xb360?
		CAST [ID[::temp391], 20]
		CMP_GE [ID[::temp393], ID[QQZQQ083], ID[::temp391]]
		CAST [ID[::temp393], ID[::temp393]]
		JMPT [ID[::temp393], 4]
		CAST [ID[::temp391], 5]
		CMP_LT [ID[::temp394], ID[QQZQQ083], ID[::temp391]]
		CAST [ID[::temp393], ID[::temp394]]
		RETURN [ID[::temp393]]

  DAMN IT getting an actorAV can HANG the fucking thread, waiting forever. Why.
  if the AV doesn't exist for the NPC make it return error at least so I can see it.
  if the NPC is broken, then... fucking put a timer on that shit?
==> CALLMETHOD GetAV ActorRef ::temp51 1 Morality
    ASSIGN actorMorality ::temp51
  
  WAT
  no seriously what fucking flag blackmagic bullshit is this

  JMPF ::temp81 13

  Training plug idea:
    Detects who master is
      If player attacks, punishes player <- need testing
      Player gets aroused from whiping
      Player orgasms, only when master does too
        Maybe only when going oral on master?
        "You longlingly think of your master " <- or something like that, if they aren't nearby and player is aroused
        "This <sex> just isn't the same as your master" <- sex with someone else, while not nearby to your master
      If player is not near master, and master is horny, can teleport player to them for sex
      distracts player if not in range of master
    If you try to remove it while still enslaved
      replaced with ghost plug
       until you put it back
       more consequences
        Disappears if you go waaaay far away from your master
          or if you put it back
          or switch masters
    Kinda want corisponding training collar
    If player goes through all training, some effects linger?
      if wearing plug, and/or after effects, cannot say no?
    If master puts a belt on you, and no plug, add this? Can we even catch this?
    
  Snags:
  Can't stop orgasm, can't allow orgasm when stopped by SLARUTIL
  Of course the belt stops orgasms so long as they have sl aroused
    but if collar or piercing...
  Could maybe get away with lowering almost all relationship ranks and such at hte start of sex, and them putting them back later...

***

Princess punishment collar:
 collar made by rich merchants and kings to punish daughters, might backfire
  can teleport player to location as temporary slave
  can bind them in shock gear
  can tie them up in painful furniture
  DM's posture pose furniture?
  temporary tattoos
 could be retrofit by the princess in later life for pleasure rather than pain
  can tie them up in 
 this might be beyond my willing threashold for pain to implement

Follower Parts needed:

# old, break up and reorganize

Follower happiness:
  Follower dislikes being told no sex multiple times in a row if arousal is above X (90 standard?)
  Follower dislikes being hit in combat (not sure if I can detect this)
  Follower dislikes sitting still too long in the cold (not sure if I can detect this)
  Follower dislikes being given short sex
  Follower likes being given long sex
  Follower likes getting oral especially (user set happyiness based on type of sex: oral/anal/vag/boob)
  Follower likes getting to use toys
  Follower dislikes not getting his turn

Follower submission:?
  How could we guess this personality?
  User assigned in the menu maybe?
  characteristics for 
    horny, submissive, aggressive,

Player submission:
  Based on choices
  Willingness to have sex while bound (item selection)
  would be cool if there was a reverse enslave option for having a slave, that wasn't bound, that turned on you by enslaving you instead

Dialogue: 
Chance based on Follower arousal and player arousal, follower must be X aroused for over X seconds, or reach Y arousal
Follower states he's really bothered.

Extra feature: Follower can show disapointment if the user has short sex -> reactions depending on gender and available bondage gear

# this is old, look at follower dialogue instead
player is approached by friendly NPC, because NPC has noticed player likes it (()
    
    player started:
      Hold my keys? 
      Remove my items?
      Wanna sex?
      Hey check this out! I think it might look good on you!
    
    Hey, I know you like bondage, check this out! ; can we detect dead bodies and/or area with interesting treasure
      <show item they found>
      <talk about sex shop where you can buy stuff (CD,calypses?)>
    Hey, <name> lets have sex <- needs alternative
      passive answers high chance to say no, decreases with every no
      Go fuck yourself
      Or do you need a whore? Lets head to town (passive, can only use 2-3 times in a row before he grows impatient)
        Sometimes agrees, sometimes wants something else
      Yes, but lets move
        Option for public or private, even furniture?      
      No you need to calm down
        Chastity option?
        We're in bad area (excuse)
        Gag them
        Arm tie them
      
    Hey why don't we play a game?/?//
    I've noticed how much you enjoy having sex while tied up, I know this great guy who would like to tie you up.
      submissive option -> become slve
        if there was a sex with this guy, then dialogue, that would be cool but needs more work
      aggressive no if follower is slave (intimidate)
      say no
        double checked
          ...yes: points back to above
          no 
            dropped
            submissive training (needs available mods)
            rape? needs to be rare
            sex?
              ?
              
    Want to join in?

need to test:

  Mia's lair again?
    fix Mia's lair start state problems, the end of the onthetrail quest should also probably be protected, since the player is busy with slaves

  Retest the DEC enslavement entrances, checking for which ones are the slowest, longest
